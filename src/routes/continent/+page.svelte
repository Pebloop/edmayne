			<p>
				Edmayne is an isolated continent surrounded by the barriers,
				a big region of water filled with sea monsters and dangerous currents
				that prevent anyone from entering or leaving the continent.
			</p>

			<p>
				The continent is divided into 3 parts, The good lands, the corrupted lands and the isolated lands.
				Those regions don't communicate much with each others, the corrupted lands being too hostile to travel through
				and being believed to be cursed by the good lands inhabitants.
